                <p>We have a vision. It includes beautiful mixed drinks, small plates to share and a comfortable ambience.

We would draw from european cuisines, traditions and stylings……..we love to play with charcuterie, confits, tonnato, caprese, cured olives, farmstead cheeses and organic local produce. The time is coming to gather and reacquaint ourselves in traditional fashion.

We are giving ourselves space to create and will open for dinners soon with intention, inviting all of our patrons to come and visit us once again..   stay tuned for updates.
